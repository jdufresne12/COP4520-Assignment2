    Problem 1: Minotaur's Birthday Party
        A minotaur invites N guests to his birthday party. They all arrive, but can only go in one at a time, when he calls them.
        He may call the same guest multiple times. Guests announce they have all entered the labyrinth, so that the minotaur is aware.
        Now the guests must come up with a strategy to let the Minotaur know that every guest entered the Minotaurâ€™s labyrinth.
